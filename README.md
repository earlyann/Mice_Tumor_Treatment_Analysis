## Project Overview:

In this analysis, I investigated a dataset that tracked the efficacy of various drug regimens on mice with tumors. The goal of this project was to gain insights into the effectiveness of different treatments and to identify trends and correlations between different variables in the data.

Methods and Technologies Used:
The project involved a variety of data preparation, cleaning, and analysis techniques. These included:
  - Data merging and cleaning with Pandas
  - Summary statistics generation (mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and standard error) using Pandas
  - Bar and pie chart creation with both Pandas and Matplotlib's PyPlot
  - Quartile calculation, outlier identification, and box plot creation using Pandas
  - Line and scatter plot creation, correlation and regression analysis with Pandas and                 Matplotlib's PyPlot
  
### Project Description:
The analysis was broken down into several tasks. First, I cleaned and merged the data to create a single dataframe. Next, I generated summary statistics for each drug regimen, including the mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and standard error. I then used both Pandas and Matplotlib's PyPlot to create bar and pie charts to visualize the total number of timepoints for all mice tested for each drug regimen, and the distribution of female versus male mice.

I also created box plots comparing the final tumor volume data for four of the treatment groups (Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin), calculating quartiles and identifying outliers. Finally, I investigated the relationship between the weight of mice and the size of their tumors, creating line and scatter plots and performing correlation and regression analysis.

### Outputs and Conclusion:
The final output of the project was a Jupyter notebook containing all of the code, visualizations, and written analysis. Through the analysis, I identified several interesting insights, including the effectiveness of certain drug regimens, the impact of weight on tumor size, and the differences in performance between male and female mice. These insights could be used to inform future research and treatment options for cancer patients.
