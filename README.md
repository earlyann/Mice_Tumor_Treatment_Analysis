Module 5 Plotting Challenge

In this assignment I was looking at a dataset of mice that were being treated with different drug regimens for tumors. The dataset captures the size of the tumor at different timepoints in the treatment. This assignment is broken down into the following tasks:

-Prepare the data - the data was merged into a single dataframe and cleaned.
-Generate summary statistics - looking at the mean, median, variance, standard deviation and standard error per  drug regimen
-Create bar charts and pie charts - using both Pandas and PyPlot, I looked at total number of timepoints for all mice tested for each drug regimen and the distribution of female versus male mice
-Calculate quartiles, find outliers, and create a box plot - working with four of the treatment groups (Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin) created box plots comparing the final tumor volume data
-Create a line plot and a scatter plot and correlation and regression - here I looked at the weight of mice compared to the size of their tumor
-Final analysis- this is included in my notebook.
